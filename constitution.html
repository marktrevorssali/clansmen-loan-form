    <p>As members of the Clansmen Saving & Support Fund, we pledge to uphold unity, trust, and financial discipline for the growth and well-being of all clansmen. We commit not only to the success of this initiative today — but to building a legacy that lives with us, grows with us, and stands the test of time. This is not just a group; it is a lifelong brotherhood rooted in purpose, pride, and progress.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
    <p><b>⚠️ Disclaimer:</b> As a clansman, imagine your AURA pouring just because you failed to raise UGX 2,000... (Now UGX 5,000). This saving culture is a matter of pride, unity, and honor — not just money. Let’s uphold the name and spirit of the Clansmen by being timely, disciplined, and supportive.</p>
